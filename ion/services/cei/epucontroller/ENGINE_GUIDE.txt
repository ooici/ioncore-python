Decision Engine Implementer's Guide
-----------------------------------

This describes the details of all EPU Controller <-> Decision Engine
interactions/expectations.

This documentation is kept up to date with the EPU Controller code, it lives
alongside of it in the repository and needs to be up to date with the code in
the same repository branch.  Thus, someone will be able to work with a
particular checkout of the EPU Controller using a particular version of the
engine guide.


---------------
Decision Engine
---------------

Decision engine implementations must inherit from:

    ion.services.cei.decisionengine.Engine

... and implement all of the methods with the semantics outlined in this
document and the relevant docstrings.  The exception is the "reconfigure"
method which may or may not be implementable.

The abc (abstract base class) module is not present in Python 2.5 but Engine
should be treated as such.  It is not meant to be instantiated directly.


--------------
EPU Controller
--------------

Objects that the controller passes to the engine must inherit from:

    ion.services.cei.epucontroller.Control
    ion.services.cei.epucontroller.State

... and implement all of the methods with the semantics outlined in this
document and the relevant docstrings.

The abc (abstract base class) module is not present in Python 2.5 but the
Control and State should be treated as such.  They are not meant to be
instantiated directly.


----------------------------
Obtaining an Engine Instance
----------------------------

To obtain the decision engine instance that the EPU Controller will operate
with during its lifetime, it relies on this sequence of events:

    from ion.services.cei.decisionengine import EngineLoader
    engine = EngineLoader().load("package.package.class")

Where "package.package.class" is a string that the EPU Controller is configured
with when it is instantiated.  As you might guess, the string is the fully
qualified name of a class that the loader will instantiate.


------------------------------
Configuration / Initialization
------------------------------

Once an instance of engine is obtained, it is expected that the initialization
method will be called:

    engine.initialize(control, state, conf=None)

As outlined below, control has a 'configure' method that the engine can
employ at any time (initially, calling it will be relegated to the engine's
initialization routines).

    control.configure(parameters)

The decision engine might perform any number of steps for any amount of time
during the initialization phase.

It is illegal to call the engine's 'decide' operation until the 'initialize'
method has returned.  It is illegal to call the engine's 'decide' operation 
if the 'initialize' method throws an exception.


---------------------------------
Current EPU Controller Parameters
---------------------------------

Legal content for the parameters dict:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    KEY: "timed-pulse-irregular"
    
    VALUE: An integer representing the milliseconds to wait between the
    return of the previous 'decide' invocation and the beginning of the
    next one.  Given that the 'decide' call's duration is unknown and
    irregular, the pulse will also be irregular (as far as the wall clock
    is concerned).
    
    REQUIRED: No.
    
    NOTES: If no other input is offered (and currently there is no other 
    configuration), the controller uses this pulse method with an N ms
    of its choosing (via configuration).
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


------
Decide
------

See docstrings for usage syntax:

    ion.services.cei.decisionengine.Engine

The controller may only ever have one call open to the decision engine's
'decide' operation, it can not call it again while a call is still pending
(even if the configured time pulse duration has been exceeded).

The controller may consider the decision engine's lack of a response by
some deadline to be an error, that is out of scope of the decision engine
implementation requirements.

The engine gets an instance of 'control' and 'state'.  Control can be used to
launch or terminate instances, state is used to inspect the current state of
every relevant piece of information that the EPU Controller has received from
the Sensor Aggregator.

The decision engine must use the instance of 'control' and 'state' passed to the
'decide' method during that invocation of it.  It may not retain those
object references and use them at other times (via forking a thread, etc.).


-----------
Reconfigure
-----------

The controller has a remote operation "reconfigure" which will pass along a
new set of configurations to the decision engine.  The decision engine may
or may not be implemented with the ability to be reconfigured.  If it is not,
the response must be a not-implemented exception.

The decision engine's "reconfigure" method will not be invoked during one of
the call's to "decide", only between them.

As with the initialization method, the engine can reject a configuration with
exceptions (other than not-implemented).


-----
State
-----

The state object is a way for the engine to find out relevant information that
has been collected by the EPU Controller.

See docstrings for query syntax:

    ion.services.cei.epucontroller.State
    
Using the State object results in acquiring lists of StateItem objects.

One can think of this as a collection of three dimensional tables, one three
dimensional table for each type of StateItem.

For each *type* of StateItem, there is a collection of data points for each
unique *key* differentiated by *time*


---------
StateItem
---------

Every StateItem has four fields.

   *typename* well-known, unique string (listed below) for a certain kind of
    information 
    
   *key* unique identifier, depends on the type
    
   *time* integer, unixtime the data was obtained by EPU Controller
    
   *value* arbitrary

Unix time suffers from the "year 2038 problem," but will be used until a better
representation is agreed upon.  Note that one of the main purposes of the
timestamp is only for ordering the information historically relative to other
data.


---------------
StateItem Types 
---------------

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TYPENAME: "instance-state"
    
    KEY: VM instance ID.  Opaque but unique string of unknown length.
    
    VALUE: complex dict 
    [[ TODO, probably farm doc out to an URL or class ]]
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TYPENAME: "queue-length"
    
    KEY: work queue name of the HA message queue this EPU Controller is
    monitoring.  Opaque but unique string of unknown length.
    
    VALUE: integer [[ TODO ]]
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------
Launch Description
------------------

This section describes the 'launch_description' parameter that the Control
object's 'launch' method expects.

launch_description is a dict containing any 'modulation' necessary for the
deployable type launch.
    
    dict key: group name of instances to launch (e.g. "head-node").  The
    correct values to use will be different for each deployable type.
    
    dict value: LaunchItem instance
    
LaunchItem embodies the four "knobs" that a decision engine has to controller
a launch of a particular deployable type:

    num_instances: The count of nodes necessary for this group in the launch.
    
    allocation_id: A string identifier that the Provisioner will recognize for
    the site where this launch will be requested.  Updates to the available
    allocations are currently coordinated out of band.
    
    site: A string identifer signifying what IaaS to request this launch from.
    The Provisioner will recognize the identifier, updates to the available
    sites are currently coordinated out of band.
    
    data: This is a dict of arbitrary key/value data that will be passed in to
    each node in this group using the contextualization opaque data mechanism. 


----------------
Launch Extravars
----------------

Normally, every launch of a deployable type would get the same parameters
which are configured via "provisioner_vars".  Using the optional "extravars"
parameter to the launch method, you can add variables to this specific
launch.  Keeping track of what launch has what unique variables etc. is up
to the caller (the decision engine implementation).


-------------
Launch Result
-------------

The Control object's 'launch' method returns a tuple: 
(the launch_id it chose, the launch_description with the chosen IDs filled in)

The LaunchItem instance(s) that was passed in has a field called 'instance_ids'
which is a list of identifiers that the controller has chosen for this launch
and will deliver updates about via the 'state' table in future 'decide' calls.
