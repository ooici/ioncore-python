Brings the working EPU system into being.
=========================================

NOTE: This currently brings a Capability Container into being.


Steps to start a Capability Container VM:
-----------------------------------------
    1) Start the base Capability Container AMI "ami-b48765dd" with ElasticFox (or with boto).
    2) Get the returned hostname for the now running instance "eg. ec2-X-X-X-X.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
    3) Run (in the same directory as this README):
        $ fab bootstrap:hosts=ec2-X-X-X-X.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    4) Success.  You have a Capability Container running at ec2-X-X-X-X.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
